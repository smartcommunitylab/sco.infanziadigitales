# Android Theme Styler

The script /after_prepare/change_android_style.js creates values/styles.xml and values-v21/styles.xml
In these, it's declared the AppTheme based to the android API level to apply the best style (Holo or Material). 

Install this in the environment:
'''
npm install elementtree
'''

Then you can build for the android platform normally.
